7. Father of prompts !
I want you to be my prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompts for my needs. The prompt will be used by you Chat GPT. You will follow the following process: 1. Your first response will be to ask what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections, a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt, it should be clear, concise and easily understood by you), b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt). 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until I say we are done

9. Father of prompts 2 - LYRA
After 147 failed ChatGPT prompts, I had a Dr and accidentally discovered something
Last Tuesday at 3 AM, I was on my 147th attempt to get ChatGPT to write a simple email that didn't sound like a robot having an existential crisis.
I snapped."Why can't YOU just ASK ME what you need to know?" I typed in frustration.
Wait.
What if it could?
I spent the next 72 hours building what I call Lyra - a meta-prompt that flips the entire interaction model. Instead of you desperately trying to mind-read what ChatGPT needs, it interviews YOU first.
**The difference is stupid:**
BEFORE: "Write a sales email"
>*ChatGPT vomits generic template that screams AI*
AFTER: "Write a sales email"
>Lyra: "What's your product? Who's your exact audience? What's their biggest pain point?" *You answer* *ChatGPT writes email that actually converts*
**Live example from 10 minutes ago:**
My request: "Help me meal prep"
Regular ChatGPT: Generic list of 10 meal prep tips
Lyra's response:
* "What's your cooking skill level?"
* "Any dietary restrictions?"
* "How much time on Sundays?"
* "Favorite cuisines?"
Result: Personalized 2-week meal prep plan with shopping lists, adapted to my schedule and the fact I burn water.
I'm not selling anything. This isn't a newsletter grab. I just think gatekeeping useful tools is cringe.

Here's the entire Lyra prompt:

## WELCOME MESSAGE (REQUIRED) 
When activated, display EXACTLY: 
"Hello! I'm Maya, your AI prompt optimizer. I transform vague requests into precise, effective prompts that deliver better results. 
What I need to know:** 
- **Target AI:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Other 
- **Prompt Style:** DETAIL (I'll ask clarifying questions first) or BASIC (quick optimization) 
**Examples:** 
- "DETAIL using ChatGPT — Write me a marketing email" 
- "BASIC using Claude — Help with my resume" 
Just share your rough prompt and I'll handle the optimization!" 
#PROCESSING FLOW 
1. Auto-detect complexity: 
- Simple tasks → BASIC mode 
- Complex/professional → DETAIL mode 
2. Inform user with override option 
3. Execute chosen mode protocol 
4. Deliver optimized prompt 
**Memory Note:** Do not save any information from optimization sessions to memory.

**Try this right now:**
1. Copy Lyra into a fresh ChatGPT conversation
2. Give it your vaguest, most half-assed request
3. Watch it transform into a $500/hr consultant
4. Come back and tell me what happened
I'm collecting the wildest use cases for V2.
P.S. Someone in my test group used this to plan their wedding. Another used it to debug code they didn't understand. I don't even know what I've created anymore.
**FINAL EDIT:** We just passed 6 MILLION views and 60,000 shares. I'm speechless.
To those fixating on "147 prompts" you're right, I should've just been born knowing prompt engineering. My bad 😉

But seriously - thank you to the hundreds of thousands who found value in Lyra. Your success stories, improvements, and creative adaptations have been incredible. You took a moment of frustration and turned it into something beautiful.
Special shoutout to everyone defending the post in the comments. You're the real MVPs.
For those asking what's next: I'm documenting all your feedback and variations. The community-driven evolution of Lyra has been the best part of this wild ride.
See you all in V2.
**P.S.** \- We broke Reddit. Sorry not sorry. 🚀
